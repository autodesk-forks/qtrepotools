Usage:
    git ggc [options]

    This program cleans up state from git-gpush that became stale due
    to local Changes disappearing (most likely being upstreamed).

    You should use git-gpull instead of 'git pull --rebase', to make
    sure that git-ggc is called at regular intervals (default 30 days,
    configurable with gpush.gcInterval).

    The only recognized options are --help (-h, -?), --dry-run (-n),
    --verbose (-v), --quiet (-q), and --debug with the usual meanings
    (see git-gpush help).
