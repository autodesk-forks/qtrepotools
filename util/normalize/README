This tool greps through files for SIGNAL() or SLOT() macros and pipes the signals/slots
through QMetaObject::normalizedSignature().

Rationale: In connect statements, you'll get a micro-speed update when passing in normalized
signatures for signals and slots.

Run it without any arguments to see the command line parameters.

Typical usage on Qt:

# find all files with non-normalized signal/slot connections
normalize $QTDIR/src
# replace all non-normalized signal/slots
normalize --modify $QTDIR/src
# "git diff" and/or "git gui" to see that everything is OK then submit :)
cd $QTDIR/src
git commit -a -m "Normalize signal/slot signatures"
